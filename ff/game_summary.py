Generate fantasy football game summaries.

This script uses the espn-api library to fetch game data for a given week
and generate a markdown summary of each matchup.

The main data object is the `League` class from `espn_api.football`,
which provides access to teams, settings, scores, and more.
See docs/espn-api.wiki/League-Class.md for more details.
